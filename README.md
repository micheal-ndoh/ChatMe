ChatMe is a simple chat application written in Rust that demonstrates how to use threads and channels for communication between senders and receivers. The application consists of two parts:

Local Chat (Threading version): A multi-threaded, single-process implementation where messages are sent between sender and receiver threads within the same machine.
Distributed Chat (Networking version): A TCP-based version where a client sends messages to a server, and the server receives and displays the messages. This version allows communication between different machines over a network.

## Project Overview

The ChatMe project is designed to demonstrate basic concepts around multi-threading and communication protocols in Rust. It consists of two main versions:

Local Chat (Threading version): Both the sender and receiver are running in separate threads on the same machine and communicate through Rust's mpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) channels.
Distributed Chat (Networking version): Uses TCP sockets for communication between a client (sender) and a server (receiver), where the client can send messages to the server over a network connection.

This project is intended for learning and experimentation with Rust's concurrency and networking capabilities.
Technologies Used

Rust: The programming language used to implement the entire chat application.
Standard Library: Utilized features from Rust's standard library including std::thread, std::sync::mpsc, and std::net for threading, channels, and networking respectively.

## Local Chat (Threading)

In this version, both the sender and receiver are running as separate threads within the same process. They communicate through an in-memory channel (mpsc::channel), simulating a real-time message exchange.
Features
Multi-threaded design with sender and receiver running on separate threads.
Communication between threads is achieved using Rust channels (mpsc).
Simple message passing using a Message struct that contains a sender's name and message cont

## Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dericko681/ChatMe.git
cd chatme
```

Install Rust (if not already installed): Follow the official instructions: <https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started>

Build the Project: Inside the project directory, run the following command to build the project:

```
cargo build
```

Run the Application: To run the local chat version, simply run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This will start the application with multiple sender threads, each sending messages to a receiver thread.

Running the Application

When you run the program, it will simulate two sender threads sending messages to a receiver thread. The output will look like this:

Sent message: Hello from Sender 1
Sent message: Second message from Sender 1
Received message from Sender 1: Hello from Sender 1
Received message from Sender 1: Second message from Sender 1
Sent message: Hello from Sender 2
Sent message: Second message from Sender 2
Received message from Sender 2: Hello from Sender 2
Received message from Sender 2: Second message from Sender 2

## Distributed Chat (Networking)

In this version, a server listens for incoming connections from clients. A client connects to the server and sends messages, which are then displayed by the server.
Features

    Server listens for incoming connections on a specified IP and port.
    Client connects to the server and sends messages.
    Communication between the client and server is done using TCP sockets.

## Setup Instructions

Run the Server: In one terminal window, run the server (this will listen for incoming connections on port 7878):

cargo run --bin server

Run the Client: In a separate terminal window, run the client to send messages to the server. Make sure the server is running first!

    cargo run --bin client

 The client will connect to the server on 127.0.0.1:7878 by default and send a message. The server will print the received message.

Running the Server

    The server listens on port 7878 by default and can accept multiple client connections.
    It will spawn a new thread to handle each incoming connection and print the received messages.

Running the Client

    The client connects to the server using TcpStream::connect().
    It will prompt the user to input a message and send it to the server.
    After sending the message, the client will exit.

Additional Notes

    If you're looking to extend this project, consider implementing advanced features like message encryption, user authentication, or saving chat history to a database.
    You can also experiment with adding a GUI using libraries like gtk-rs or crossterm for terminal-based UIs.
